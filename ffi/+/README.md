# k+

k+ is a c build of k + wrappers around external c libraries.
the interface is the c-api:

# c-api (k.h)

the idea is to have a common k to c interface for multiple implementations of k.
currently ngn/k and ktye/k implement the interface.

those who write bindings to c libraries only need to know how the interface works without having to learn all implementation details of the interpreter.

the c-api is defined in [k.h](k.h)

# ktye.h

ktye.h is the c version of ktye/k.
It is generated from the source files in the toplevel directory using a custom compiler [ktye/wg](https://github.com/ktye/wg).
The generated c code is pretty large, the expressions are converted to many single assignments but the c compiler should be able to tranform this into acceptable binaries.

It should be portable using stdio, stdlib(malloc) and setjmp(error recovery).

k.c is the main application that includes all extensions.

# building

The file mk builds the k+ binary for windows. it is tested with mingw from [web64devkit](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2020/09/25/).  

Linux (debian/ubuntu) can use mk.lin which needs ktye.h and sqlite3.c generated before.
These are available in [k+.tar.gz](https://github.com/ktye/i/releases/download/latest/k%2B.tar.gz)
