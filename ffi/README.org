** [deprecated]
Under ~archive/~ you will find examples of using the FFI interface to
[[https://ngn.codeberg.page][ngn/k]].  See ~README.org~ there for details.

** Changes
In [[https://growler.codeberg.page][growler/k]] (a fork of ngn/k) some changes to the interface have been
made to hopefully make it easier to write FFI extensions as well as allow
them to be more performant.  Changes are on going, but the hope is to keep
the examples in this directory up to date.

More to come...
