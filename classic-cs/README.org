* A Collection of classic CS algorithms
  This is just a collection of classic CS algorithms implemented in [[https://ngn.codeberg.page/][ngn/k]].  Some may be useful in
  actual programming contexts but the primary motivation was a mix of practice and exposition.

  ngn/k is afterall interpretted and therefore can't compete with algorithms hand-crated in lower
  level languages.  On the other hand, you don't always have the luxury to mix languages just to
  use a particular algorithm in your project.

  Not today, but hopefully some day.
