* ngnk-libs
  A collection of projects written in K.

Ideally some of these would serve as a basis for collaboration to create some generally useful tools
for [[https://ngn.codeberg.page/][ngn/k]].  As there's not a lot of this around, there aren't any standards for how this
should/could be organized.  I've decided to put each script in a separate directory.  Eventually
I'll include some tests and hopefully some commentary as to how each might be used.
