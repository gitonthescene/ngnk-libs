* Cmpression in K
  This may end up having more stuff, but now it's just got sketch of an lz4 tool

** LZ4
   Currently just a sketch of a [[https://github.com/lz4/lz4/tree/dev][lz4]] decompression tool.  See example.

*** Caveats
  - Doesn't currently fully process all [[https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/doc/lz4_Frame_format.md][frame options]] and hence doesn't fully process the frame
  - The ~dcm~ function evaluates the frame descriptor and then processes the block data
  - If there is a content checksum then it's just in the leftover data
  - Content Size is calculated but not used
  - Block Checksums are simply ignored
